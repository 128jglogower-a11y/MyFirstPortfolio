  <h2>Hi, I'm Jayden G, a sophomore web design student.</h2>
  <p>This is my first year doing web design, so I don't have much experience yet. I have created websites with HTML and CSS, with and without animations, some with navbars, etc. I like web design because I can be as creative as I want, and create my websites to my liking. I also like the challenges it presents.</p>
